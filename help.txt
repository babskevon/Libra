LONG DESCRIPTION
    Libra Help describes a few shortcuts and how to use Libra software to improve
    and get familiar with the package.
    This software is intended to improve efficiency in libraries that are still using
    native documents to store and access library information.
    This software was made as user friendly as possible so we hope you may not need
    much of this document as there is nothing much in it.
